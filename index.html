1. When I opened up the intro to HTML file it reminded me of when I was at Yearup and how one of our assignments was to learn how to workon a team to be able tocreate something. It's been a while since that project, I actually kind of forgot what we had to do. I just remember we found the answer because one guy decied to paste the script in to a browser and was able to analyze it and take out the unecessary parts.
2. Reading through the html article I find it weird that we are learning heavily on javascript and makes me happy that I chose this path because I've heard and read that javascript is one of the toughest languages to learn. Especially because there's so much math involved.
3.the <em> script in html does italics. </em>, this article was great. I need to look deeper in to the different types of htmml files there are that web browsers read.
