<p> &nbsp; One of my passion projects is to build a website from scratch for a buddy of mine that wants to make collars for pets in a unique way. We basically want to make a sales app like an ebay or amazon but solely for collars, likee  a 
macys.com. </p> 
<p> I would also love to be able to make my own server to test out just to see what I can do with the skills I can learn online and by just trial and failure. It's and awesome idea to me because I see so many websites thathost files and information that I always log in to and I think to myself t"that should not be that hard to do, I can do that myself!" </p>
Another awesome thing I'd like to get in to more after WDI is going to hackathons. My first hackathon was when I was an intern at Autodesk. It was so much fun! I didn't know much but being there with all the people writing out on their consoles was amazing.</p>
